# Cyment is the rock solid foundation your static generated site needs to enable your readers to bring content

It aims at being like (and is no linked to) staticman but strives to be more reliable. Here is how to get started.

## 1. Invite `cymentbot` to contribute to your static site Github project.

## 2. Send me a donation

Why? 

* Because hosting a service is not free. 

* Because I value my time.

Still don't want to donate? Fine, you can host yourself cyment or staticman and still benefits from static comments!

## 3. Wait for me to approve your invitation

I am trying very hard to be as fast as possible. If you find I take to long, log an issue at cymentbot/this-is-to-slow

## 4. Setup forms in your site pointing to cyment api

Then just add form to your pages:

```html
<form action="http://localhost:3000/<your_pseudo>/<you're repo>" method="POST">
	<input type="hidden" name="path" 
           value="<path where you want to store comments>" />
    <input type="hidden" name="redirect" 
           value="<url where your readers will be redirected after posting a comment>" />
    Author:<br>
    <input type="text" name="commenter" value="Bad guy"><br>
    Comment:<br>
    <input type="text" name="comment" value="This sucks"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In the pull request generated by cymentbot you should see a new file created at `comments/<path>/<randomId>.markdown`. It migh look like:

```markdown
---
author: Bad guy
published: published: Mon, 06 Sep 2010 00:01:00 UTC
---
This suck
```

The `redirect` param is used to redirect your reader after the comment has been post. Currently `cyment` does not support any configuration such as `staticman` yml configuration file. Leave with it, make a PR or wait: I might do it myself in a distant future.

## 5. Deploy your updated site and everything should be rolling

Currently all user content needs to be moderated, therefore you need to keep up with your project cymentbots's generated PR.
